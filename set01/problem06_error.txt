No errors during compile

Logical error found -->  greatest in 6422300 and 6422296 amd 6422292 is -478635655
int a, b, c,largest ; to be int a, b, c,largest = 0;

this might fix

The real issue was rintf(" greatest in %d and %d amd %d is %d\n"); in this line
rintf(" greatest in %d and %d amd %d is %d\n", a,b,c,largest); , forgot to specify the variable
