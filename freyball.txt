Frey ball Algorith

baseline flow

Freyball game-> measured through points and fouls, simple team with more points if points same less fouls win -> played by a team of fritacoles -> each fritacole has attribute 
-> name, height, integrity, ability and discipline

Basic flow of creation of team 

Structure called freyball game with frey.team1 and frey.team2 
structure called team with atributes being a fritacole array 
a fritcole with attribute s name, int height, int integrity, int ability and int discipline


Algorithm for backbone structure

structure fritacole 
{
    int height 
    s nameint integrity
    int ability
    int discipline

}

structure team 
{ 
    fritacole members[]
    int points;
    int fouls;

}

structure frey 
{ 
    team team1;
    team team2;
   

}

input fritcaole(fritcole ein) {

    ein.name = name input
    ein.height = height input 
    //and so on and so forth

}

int newscore() {
    regular scanf input
}

newmembers(fritacole a[], int no)
{  

    fritcaole input_frit;
    
    for (i<no) {
  
   input_fritacole(fritacole *input_frit)
   a[i] = input frit:

    } 

}

team newteam(int no)
{
    team a;
    a.members[no] = newmembers(a.members, no)
    give points
    a.points = newscore()
    give fouls
    a.fouls = newscore()
}



int main {

frey freygame;
input("number of memebrs in each team as"  int no)
freygame.team1 = newteam(no) //retrurn accepted in type team
team 1 is created 
inpyt team 2
freygame.team2 = newteam(no);

}
